## Useful Lines

### Coding Convention
* Naming functions like this is a "coding convention".
* an agreement among developers about how to format code.
* Formatting all the code similarly makes it easier to read and learn from code that other programmers have written.
* When you see code from other Android developers, it will usually be formatted using these conventions.

### Function
* A function is a section of a program that performs a specific task.
* The fun keyword marks some code as a function.
* After the fun keyword follows the name of the function, parentheses for optional input to the function (arguments), and curly braces.
* Your code for printing text always went inside those curly braces.

### Loop
* A loop is an instruction to repeat instructions multiple times.

### Refactoring
* changing the code to make it better or easier to work with without changing the output is called "refactoring".
